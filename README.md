# It's-a me! Jose!

* :speaking_head: My name is pronounced /xoˈse/.
* 🌎 I'm a 🇻🇪 living in 🇦🇷.
* 👨‍💻 Doing things with computers since I'm 7 years old.
* :man_office_worker: I work every day with Kubernetes, Terraform, Bash and Go. And love designing and building the simplest, cleanest systems you can ever come around. Currently doing it at @foxcorp for the Platforms Engineering team.
* 📧 I'm not very active in social networks, but you can always send me an email. It's not hard to figure it out since it's in all my commits.
